## Overview

### What Animack does (functional requirements)

It will provide you with basic functionalities of an anime & manga app tracker. It will:

1. `Search` for a anime or manga given a specific or general title.
2. Give you the option to `add the show` to your list.
3. Give you the ability to `edit`/`track` your progress on a show manually in 'My List' section.
4. Give you the option to `rate` the selected show on a scale of 10.
5. And finally, your list is saved on a sigle file which you can `export` and save elsewhere or `import` another file.
